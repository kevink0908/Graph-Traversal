# Graph Traversal
This repository contains the source codes for the implementations of the algorithms for both breadth-first traversal and depth-first traversal. The two traversal algorithms will be performed on a given graph by utilizing the adjacency matrix representation of a [GivenGraph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98494454/167744281-e48b2c1d-c114-45df-baf6-ac44e1a9a531.png).
